For the PSTAT 234 Final Group Project, we analyzed the hate crimes data set found in the [FiveThirtyEight Github repositiory](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes). The data set contains reported hate crime statistics in the United States broken up by state as well as demographic information for five years before and ten days after Trump was elected President. Bash and Python were used for the analysis.  

The Jupyter notebook for this project is broken into a five sections: 
- Extracting the data
- Pre-analysis and visualization
- Analyzing the data
- Model building 
- Conclusion
